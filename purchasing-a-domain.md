# Purchasing a domain

To purchase a domain and make sure we are the owners, we must go to a _domain registrar_. There are many, for example:

* Namecheap;
* GoDaddy;
* 1&1;
* 123reg.

Let's go with Namecheap since they have a good reputation and I've used them before.

### Navigate to https://www.namecheap.com

### Sign up with Namecheap

This will let you store your domains in an account for easy access in the future. We'll need that for configuration after we register a domain.

### Search for a domain

Next step after you have registered and signed in is to search for a domain. For the course we'll search for `rest-api-course-trial.com`.

Namecheap will present us with many different options. Select the one that is most reasonable for you in terms of price and domain name relevancy.

We will select `rest-api-course-trial.com`.

We can add it to the basked and proceed to "View Cart". This gives us more options before payment.

### Select renewal and privacy options

There are two things we must pay for, and a few more that are optional.

We must pay for:

* The Domain Registration. This is the cost for Namecheap to register the domain to us, and for them to make a profit.
* The ICANN fee. ICANN is the **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers**, and they "are dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable, and interoperable". Exactly what that means, nobody knows.

We can pay for:

* WhoisGuard. Upon registering a domain, your details \(email address, phone number\) are available to the public unless you purchase the WhoisGuard. I'd recommend paying for this.
* PremiumDNS. This allows you to use Verisign's DNS servers and gives you more configurability options. I wouldn't recommend paying for this because we will be using another service for this, which is free.

### Pay

Before paying, it's worth checking the [Namecheap coupons site](https://www.namecheap.com/promos/coupons.aspx), for sometimes they have discounts.

Once we've paid, the domain name will appear in our account!

**Note**: Namecheap may require you to verify your contact info at this point. It should be as easy as clicking a link in an e-mail they send you!
